# Glass-Bottle-Segregator
 This project implements a Glass Bottle Segregator using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification and Arduino for sorting. The system classifies bottles into brown, green, or clear based on color and activates servos to sort them into bins for recycling. Includes Python code, Arduino code, and a project report.
